# Workers are forked webserver processes. If using threads and workers together
# the concurrency of the application would be max `threads` * `workers`.

# processes).

# Use the `preload_app!` method when specifying a `workers` number.
# This directive tells Puma to first boot the application and load code
# before forking the application. This takes advantage of Copy On Write
# process behavior so workers use less memory.

# An internal health check to verify that workers have checked in to the master
# process within a specific time frame. If this time is exceeded, the worker
# will automatically be rebooted. Defaults to 60s.

# Under most situations you will not have to tweak this value, which is why it
# is coded into the config rather than being an environment variable.
